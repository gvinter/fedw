One resource instead of 8 - this Javascript Framework Guide is that good

Hey all,

This week is a special one with a single resource, not the usual 8. I think it'll hit home for many of you who are like me and need to dig deeper into JS frameworks to start new projects, but need more of a backstory to know what we're getting ourselves into and why... and it's written by one of YOU.

Craig McKeachie, a long-time Front-end Dev Weekly subscriber, has written the <a href="http://www.funnyant.com/frontend/">JavaScript Framework Guide</a>. The key to the guide is an incredibly important piece that most every other guide is missing: <strong>the context of a developer who hasn't chosen a framework yet</strong>. As expected, every Ember/Angular/Backbone guide directs you on implement each framework, but rarely do they guide you on how to pick which framework. Craig's guide does just that and helps you kick-off your project.

Depending on what you already know about Ember, Angular and Backbone, you might want to start at a different place in the guide...

If you're deciding whether you need a JS framework, start at the beginning. Need a lay of the JS framework land to excel your learning? Start on Chapter 4. Chapters 5-8 are an example application written in each of the frameworks so you can compare implementations. Chapter 9 gives us insight into the profile of each framework with important, but often overlooked tidbits about each framework's community, leadership, size, philosophy and maturity. There are several reasons to pick a certain framework, whether JS or not, and this chapter holds both quantitative and qualitative data for you to make a well-informed decision.

Here's the deal - Craig wants to share his JavaScript Framework Guide with the Front-end Dev Weekly community for <a href="http://www.funnyant.com/frontend/">20% off for the next 24 hours</a>. I'm not taking a cut and not getting paid to make this happen. I believe this is an awesome resource and a worthy opportunity for our community. After 24 hours, it'll be available for the <a href="http://www.javascriptframeworkguide.com/">normal price here</a>.

Say hello to Craig <a href="https://twitter.com/cmckeachie/">on Twitter</a>, share the book with your developer friends and let me know what you think!

Best,
Galen

PS. The interviews and screencasts are no joke. They're professional and high quality and have a great cadence for extracting extra learning.
