Deep Dives on content coming soon, let me know what you want to see!

It's a big learning-heavy newsletter week. That being said, I'm going to be doing deep dive write-ups on some of the content I've published to show how to apply some of the tools and resources soon. Do you have anything you were particularly curious about and wanted to see live code for?

Checking browser support for modern implementions in Sass

You won't catch me without <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>. This isn't a drop-in replacement. But if you're doing advanced CSS3 or HTML5 projects and you need a more methodical graceful degradation strategy, consider this. It's a bit complex, but it'll put you in the next class of Sass'ers.

Libraries
Filament Group
https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw

Multi-faceted responsive tables plugin

This library is what dataTables.js was for making tables useful with pagination, sorting, and Ajax calls. Now with Tablesaw we're no longer afraid of tables in mobile either.

Library
bitstat

Build custom PDFs with input placeholders

Your client says they need a custom contract builder. You groan and get ready to tell them to use RightSignature... NO MORE!. You have a new option for creating documents with placeholders in-house (and ignore the old-school styling, click the link and you'll see what I mean).

Library
http://typesettings.io/
Ian Rose

Don't let typography be your achilles heel

Stop getting to the end of your quick projects and spending loads of time adding a few pixels of padding here and there around your text. This library fixes the type-spacing issues that you can see but don't necessarily have the eye to fix.

StyleStats is a Node.js library to collect CSS statistics
Dev Tools
Koji Ishimoto

Get cold-hard stats on your CSS

StyleStats as an online tool == helpful. However, the power comes in the form of a Grunt/Gulp module. Integrating this into your workflow is a great way to keep the reins on yourself and others from letting your CSS best practices slide.

Twitter: "CSS isn't just an art, there's a science. Science requires data. StyleStats gives you that data: http://www.stylestats.org/"
