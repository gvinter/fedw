Google is flirting with you - tell me it's not a good time to be a front-end dev

I got the opportunity to talk to several of you over the past few weeks, and what I've consistently heard is "we want more tutorials". I hear you - I do too. I'm going heavy on tutorials and learning until we decide as a community otherwise. Hell, if Google's flirting with us, then we better invest in ourselves to be worthy of such a relationship ;).

You use these in JS every day, but do you know what these actually are?

Todd Motto gives us a run-down of, "what (function (window, document, undefined) {})(window, document); really means". Do you know what it "really" means?

General siblings in CSS will save you so much headache

When I was first learning CSS I read on StackOverflow, "you can't target element siblings". Who wants to go on an SO rampage with me?

Frameworks are fracturing: Foundation for Sites

This is great news. ZURB is admitting that Foundation framework was all around weaker as a single framework than it would be if it were split to divide and conquer. This is a set in the right direction.

"Help, I'm stuck in an event loop"

A young Javascripter gives a great run down of the call stack with visuals and code examples. If you're like me and a visual learner, you won't forget this presentation's visuals.
