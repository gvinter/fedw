Tools and Libraries that are moving me forward right now

In the last 2 weeks I had several projects that all had strategic technical decisions to be made. One for my personal site, another around the Front-end Dev Weekly site, and 2 more for clients. One reason this week's resources are valuable to me, is that they're going to move the needle forward faster for me in dev time, upkeep required, performance of my code on current projects. For example, I'm going to be moving my personal site to Jekyll as I grow it to be more than one page because Jekyll doesn't have the upkeep and admin stuff the WP has. Also, I have a client who love the Medium commenting and I'll likely use the link below to give them exactly that.

# Dev Tools 

Git Tower takes the cake for native Git apps
http://www.git-tower.com/
Tower 2: Version control with Git - made easy. In a beautiful, efficient, and powerful app.
fournova Software GmbH

I've been using GitX for years even for git diff'ing. I never liked any other native apps. But I must say, Git Tower is awesome, and I haven't even broken the surface of the huge amount of features. 

# Libraries

Add Medium-style side comments to your site
http://aroc.github.io/side-comments-demo/
SideComments.js
Eric Anderson

I'm going to likely use this in an upcoming client project. Challenging old forms of commenting is important, because the "comments are discussions at the bottom of the page" has a place on the internet, but isn't for everywhere.

Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages
Barry Clark

This is the second Jekyll tutorial on FEDW (first one here https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial), but the added by about hosting on Github with your personal page and its thoroughness is priceless. Needless to say, I'm going to be moving my personal site to Jekyll soon.

This is a great starting point for your team to follow, or to pass onto contractors. Even better for you, it's a great way to make sure your JS style is tight.

Brand Colors
Galen Gidman

I was recently UX designing for a client project and really wanted the HEX colors for all the major social media companies. I didn't find this in time, but better late than never. A great link to have in your bookmarks bar.

# Performance

Don't let WP images slow you down

Reduce file sizes for images within WordPress including NextGEN, GRAND FlAGallery and more.
Shane Bishop

Although I haven't done testing between this plugin and this one(http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/), I've found that especially when migrating a WordPress site, you get stuck with old, huge images.

This CriticalCSS (https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalcss) wrapper gives you an quick Grunt plugin for pulling out the most important CSS from your stylesheets to be loaded immediately so your CSS doesn't need to block page load.
