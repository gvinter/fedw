Issue 4

Less staging deploys, less manual screenshots, less browser stress.

This week's curated links felt like weight off my shoulders. After discovering Finch I feel like I've reclaimed a few hours per week while not testing. Gulp is more forgiving than Grunt and easier to get off the ground. And with an $.animate() alternative and jQuery throttle/debounce, I can reduce my code's burden on the browser. Sometimes, less is more.

A staging environment that never needs to be deployed

Found this sweet command line tool this week and was working with it in no time. I've now removed the pain point of redeploying to staging every time I have a minor fix.

Mobile click doesn't need to feel delayed

The classic battle: making your site/app feel more native on mobile. Mobile devices contribute to the issue with their 300ms delay. This library sets mobile devices straight.

Cleaner animations than jQuery, lightest weight library

Building interactive elements with jQuery but not using the rest of the jQuery library? Consider going leaner with Velocity - a fraction of the size and smoother animations.

Don't let jQuery overwork your browser

Are you using jQuery to listen and immediately react to events like resize and scroll? That's expensive for the browser - so fix it.
