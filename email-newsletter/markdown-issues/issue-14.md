Fresh inspiration for stale elements

I'm not a designer, but I sure am a sucker for fresh new takes on things that haven't seen the light of inspiration in quite some time. <a href="http://tympanus.net/Development/SelectInspiration/">Tympanus</a> and <a href="http://codyhouse.co/gem/smart-fixed-navigation/">Sebastiano Guerriero</a> do that below. This week also features the first React JS reference and I think it's a relatable place to start. React isn't for all projects, but it's run by Facebook, so I doubt it's going anywhere anytime soon!

Ps. I'm going to be in Aix en Provence, France and London starting next week for a few weeks. If you're in or around either place, I'd love to meet up and buy you a coffee or beer! <a href="mailto:galen.vinter@gmail.com">Let me know!</a>

Get started with React

You've either heard about Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> Javascript library for building user interfaces, but here's the start of a tutorial, but more importantly a few reasons that it's important in the modern web world.

"RWD Is Bad for Performance" Is Good for Performance
Tim Kadlec

RWD Is Bad... Is Good

Ever hear someone say that responsive design is bad for performance? Tim Kadlec sure has and he turns that assumption into a positive project result.

Stale selects needed a fresh take

I'm a huge <a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/">Chosen JS</a> fan for styling select elements and making them useful, but Tympanus's creative interpretations of the select element is darn impressive.

Smart Fixed Navigation
Sebastiano Guerriero

Finally, a fixed mobile nav bar solution that makes sense!

This is probably one of the best mobile nav implementations I've seen in a while. When I read on mobile devices I read towards the top of the device, but if a hamburger nav icon is up there, then it's a visual hindrance instead of a useful nav button.
