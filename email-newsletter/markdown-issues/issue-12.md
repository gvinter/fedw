Getting tricky with Sass and digging deep with tutorials on SVG, Gulp, Velocity, and Ember

I find that I'm intrigued by the tricky stuff because I can learn so much from it. I'm a fan of CodePen and jsFiddle snippets that have clever implementations of things we usually take a harder route to complete. I try not to take those for granted. Also - I try not to take all these new tutorials for granted either ;).
