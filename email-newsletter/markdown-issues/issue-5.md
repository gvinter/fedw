There is no one slider library for all sliding needs

It's easy to pick favorites when developing - a favorite pre-compiled CSS library, a favorite Javascript task runner, a favorite carousel library, or even a few basic dev tools. This week we have some articles and libraries that aren't for every project but certainly do demand that you re-evaluate your default tools, libraries and strategies.

Re-compile CSS for media query efficiency

You already know you compromise CSS efficiency by putting media queries all over the place in your Sass or Less. But you do it for organizational reasons. Don't surrender that organization, let a secondary compiler fix that for you.

A Chrome extensions that makes testing responsive sizes a breeze

We all do it - constantly resize our browser window to check responsive widths. Cut it out. 99 cents per year is a steal for this little gem. Visual custom break points and the visual interface are built the way I would build them myself, so I bought it.

In mobile it's easy to hide all content and just let headlines attempt to deliver your message. Fight this urge. Keep your content visible and the core value. One way to do this is by leveraging the x-axis.

A text editor with an API isn't your grandfather's text editor

Imagine Google Docs open sourced it's front-end. Multi-user interfaces, draft functionality, opportunities for analytics and more. Truly empowering for the front-end developer.

All other sliders are 2D. This is 3D and the future

If you need a slideshow library for 6 images with a caption each, use <a href="http://flexslider.woothemes.com/">Flexslider</a>. If you're looking for other developers to scratch their head at how you implemented a cross-browser, touch-friendly slideshow, Sequence is your answer. Caution: this isn't a 30-second implementation, but no creative endeavour is. 2nd Caution: when you see the example, you'll want to build your own.

Resize images to fit the container - from the markup

If I hadn't personally had this issue before, I'd just recommend you use background-image:url(image) and background-size:cover. However, when each image needs to be treated differently, this tiny JS library can clear up a lot of custom content headaches.
