Saving time on all fronts... front-end dev pun intended

A few ways to save time:
<ul>
<li>Write code more efficiently and use modularity.</li>
<li>Use libraries more suited for the exact task at hand.</li>
<li>Avoid running redundant processes.</li>
<li>Use native/pre-existing libraries instead of building custom ones.</li>
<li>Don't let assets loading hinder loading other assets.</li>
<li>Use task runners to combine a full workflow into a single command.</li>
</ul>
These are some of the topics included this week. Which ones do you do? <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=@gvinter%20I%20work%20faster%20by...">Tell me about it</a>.

"In object-oriented programming, the single responsibility principle states that every class should have a single responsibility". Now apply that to CSS.

Script-injected "async scripts" considered harmful
Ilya Grigorik

Script-injected scripts hurt load time. Sure, all scripts can't have the async attribute added, but more can than you probably think with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6963779/whats-the-name-of-google-analytics-async-design-pattern-and-where-is-it-used">asynchronous function queuing</a>.

An Introduction to the Web Notifications API
Aurelio De Rosa

It's quite easy and straight forward to create a notification. The downside here is mobile browser compatibility, but using the native browser notification API can sure beat implementing a new notifications system.

Grunt Email Design Workflow
Lee Munroe

It wasn't until this newsletter that I felt the pain of email design with tables, CSS inlining, and inbox testing. You feel stuck with old-school HTML hacks and feel stripped of all your front-end dev powers and tools. Get your Handlebars templates and Sass files back, and even send to <a href="http://litmus.com">Litmus</a> for testing here.
