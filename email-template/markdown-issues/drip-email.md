I started Front-end Dev Weekly because I saw a lack of focus in other curated feeds on adding presenting immediate value and actionable resources. Too many were showing you flashy libraries and SVG tigers. I've mentored several front-enders at the beginning of their developer careers and when providing them with resources I quickly learned to differentiate between the tutorials, libraries, and tools that could truly help developers out of the gate, and ones that are more aimless or basically plagarized from other sites for SEO juice.

There's an immense amount of resources in the developer ecosystem and what most of us are exposed to is just the tip of the iceberg.

So how do you find only the best stuff. The resources that will make you a better developer? The posts that show you how to school your coworkers in tidbits that aren't mainstream, but could change the course of a project? The dev tool that could cut hours a day from your deploy and testing processes? Time - lots of it! There's too much out there to distill it all without giving it loads of time, and building experience in sifting through it.

That's my role. I find some sort of, somewhat strange, pleasure in sifting through the web's front-end developer resources. I enjoy differentiating between the sites that developers should give attention to, the ones that are a complete distraction.

If you're with me here and you think I've been delivering on my promise to deliver high quality, essential front-end developer content, please do me a favor and let your friends know Twitter by sharing Front-end Dev Weekly.
